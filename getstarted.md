an up-to-date development environment.

 - [Tutorials Home](/tutorials/index.html) - covers:
   - Quickstart with Docker Images
   - Toolchains - acquiring, building
   - Platforms - loading, running and debugging programs on:
     - Simulators
     - FuseSoC
     - Litex
   - Linux - running Linux and applications on:
     - Simulators
     - FuseSoC
     - Litex

## Around the Web

This section contains guides and information found around the web that help
OpenRISC users to get started more easily.  These have been put together by the
community.

Material for beginners to soft cores on FPGA:

-   Sven-Ã…ke Andersson has written a comprehensive [blog on OpenRISC for newbies][],
    which offers a guide to the complete design flow.

Guides to the toolchain:
